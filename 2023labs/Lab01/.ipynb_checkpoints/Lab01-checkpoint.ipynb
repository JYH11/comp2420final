    "[Git](https://git-scm.com) was created in 2005 by Linux Kernel development Community (headed up by Linus Torvalds) after a _\"breakdown of the relationship between the development community and BitKeeper\"_ (A Short History of Git, n.d.). To use BitKeeper, a priority, closed-source client software was required, which didn't sit well with all members of the community. To this end, Andrew Tridgell, an ANU alumni and developer of [Samba](https://www.samba.org) and the [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) algorithm, was able to develop an open-source tool that could be used as an alternative to the BitKeeper software, known as [SourcePuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourcePuller). This triggered a disagreement between the Linux Community and BitKeeper, which resulted in Linus Torvalds announcing the Git project and moving the Linux Kernal away from BitKeeper.\n",

    "### Task 1.1: Forking, Cloning and Upstream Repositories.\n",
    "Starting from the very beginning. By the end of this task, you will be able to fork and clone git repositories, and set an upstream repository to receive updates from.\n",
    "\n",
    "*****\n",
    "#### Task 1.1.1: Forking\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Git, a directory (or set or directories) that are using Git source control are called a **Repository**, or **repo** for short. An example of a Git repo is the [COMP2420 Labs repo](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2420/2023/comp2420-2023-labs), which will hold all the labs for this course. Another separate repo will be used for your assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it can be useful for multiple people to have access to a Git repo for collaborating on a single piece of work or distributing work being performed in parallel, this is not always the case. Imagine having a single repo for the 400 students in this course, when there is only 1 lab document. Either 1 person does the work, and no one else gets the change, or everyone does it and we end up with merge issues (we will cover this later). Either way, it isn't fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, **Forking** is designed to mitigate this issue. When you fork a repo, you take a copy of what the repo contains at that point in time, and gain ownership over that forked copy of the repo. Note it is a _copy_ of the repo, and not the original. This allows us to distribute lab work to 400 students by getting each student to fork the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time for us to fork the [COMP2420 Labs repo](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2420/2023/comp2420-2023-labs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, this can be performed all on the CECS Gitlab site, all through the web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps will guide you through the process:\n",
    "1. Navigate to the [COMP2420 Labs repo](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2420/2023/comp2420-2023-labs) on the CECS Gitlab site.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the top right hand corner, you will notice a `Fork` Button. Click it.\n",
    "![Fork Example](./img/forkingexamples1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select your Gitlab Account as the namespace for the forked repository. This will give you ownership over the forked repo.\n",
    "![Fork Example2](./img/forkingexamples2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will now see a `Fork In Progress` notice and eventually, the page will refresh. You now have your own fork of the repo! You can tell it is yours if underneath the title it states `Forked from ....`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fork Output](./img/forkedoutput.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's it! You now have your own repo. Unfortunately, you're not finished yet. The next step is getting a copy on your local device.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "#### Task 1.1.2: Cloning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: If you have not installed Git on your computer yet, you will be unable to do this and the following tasks. Go install Git if you have not done so.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While a repository denotes the directory containing code and other content, there needs to be an ability to grab this content from the hosting server so you can make changes locally. To this end, Git uses **Cloning** to allow you to download the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can clone a single repository onto multiple devices, and synchronise changes between devices using the repo. We will start with cloning the repo onto a local device, and touch base on sending and receiving changes further on within the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps will guide you through cloning (downloading) a repository on your local device.\n",
    "1. Open terminal/git bash (depending on your operating system and programs installed) and navigate to a location where you are happy for the repository to be downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From your project page (the **forked project**, as above), copy the cloning url into your clipboard. For the sake of the tutorial, we will use the https version.\n",
    "![Clone Example](./img/cloneexamples1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In your terminal/git bash window, type the following command (where `$GITURL` is the URL from Step 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Where $GITURL is the url from Step2\n",

    "# If it isn't, it probably isn't your repo.\n",
    "# You may be trying to clone the original version.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Following this being successful, you will be asked for your gitlab username and password. Enter them (correctly). If you enter in your details incorrectly and it doesn't download, repeat step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Clone Example2](./img/cloneexamples2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Provided you entered your details correctly, the process will finish and the code will be downloaded and stored. An example output is shown below. You can now enter into the git repo using command-line or GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Clone Example3](./img/cloneexamples3.png)\n",

    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 1.1.3: Upstream Repositories\n",
    "While you have been able to fork and clone a repo, there is still one more step before we can start going ahead for the semester with changing code. Recall we mentioned above that when you fork a repo, you copy the repo as it is at that _point in time_. Any changes that are made after the fork are not propagated, unless we set up a system to do so. That is what we are going to do here.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment, the directory on your computer that is linked to your git repo only knows of your forked repository, with no information about what the true \"origin\" of the code was. We can see this by running the command `git remote -v` in terminal/git bash when in the cloned repo's directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Preupstream](./img/upstreambefore.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory considers the forked version as the \"origin\" for the code base, although in reality we know there is another repository above our forked version that we want to receive updates from. We call this the `upstream` repo. Consider the analogy of a river and you are collecting water of a certain quality 100km from the river source. If a change (such as a decrease in water quantity or quality) was to occur at the source of the river, it would (and should) effect you downstream. This is the same idea for upstream repositories in Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will guide you in setting up the original [COMP2420 Labs](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2420/2023/comp2420-2023-labs) repo as the upstream source:\n",
    "1. Using terminal/git bash, navigate to the directory in which the git repo resides. You should be able to run `git status` to determine whether you are in the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Where $UPSTREAMURL is the URL from the original repo.\n",

    "git remote add upstream $UPSTREAMURL\n",

    "# An example URL may be:\n",
    "#   https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2420/2023/comp2420-2023-labs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will add the upstream URL as a repository to be monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Confirm the upstream repository has been added by entering the following command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",

    "![Postupstream](./img/upstreamafter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see a second set of URLs present, with your uni ID replaced with the COMP2420 gitlab user.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all that, your repository is finally set up and you can start to complete labs on your device! Note Task 1.1.2 and Task 1.1.3 will need to be repeated for each new device you use, but after a while it will become second nature.\n",

    "There will come a time where you have made some changes to the lab files in your repo and you want to make sure you save it on your repo, or you need to send code to your repo for an assignment to be marked. This process of sending content back to your repo on the central server is known as **Pushing** your code. The following will show you how to push your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Firstly, you need to check what files have actually changed. In your terminal/git bash, run the following command when in the directory that holds your git repo:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "If no changes have been made and everything is up to date, you should see the following:\n",

    "  ![Status Dirty](./img/gitstatusdirty.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Notice how the files that have been changed (but aren't ready to push) will come up in <span style=\"color:red\">Red</span>. We want to change this so they are tracked and ready to be pushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To track the previously untracked files (get the files ready for sending back to the repo), run the following command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note the `.` means everything in that directory and below will become tracked changes. You should see something similar to below when you run `git status` again:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Status Green](./img/gitstatusgreen.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Notice how the files that have been changed (and are almost ready to be pushed) will come up in <span style=\"color:green\">Green</span>. We want to now \"commit\" to these changes to push back to the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To \"commit\" to these changes going back into the central server, run the following command\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Where \"$YOUR $COMMIT $MESSAGE $HERE\" is a short message of the changes made.\n",
    "git commit -m \"$YOUR $COMMIT $MESSAGE $HERE\"\n",
    "# An example message might be \"Finished Lab01\".\n",

    "\n",
    "  After this, it is now time to push the committed code back to the repository on the central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now comes the easy bit, pushing the code back to the server. Enter the following command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be asked for your gitlab username (your uni id) and password, and then it will compress and send the code back up. An example output is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Git Push](./img/gitpush.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note: If your push is rejected, you may need to pull first since you can only push if you are completely up to date. Follow the steps to pull below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, your code will now reflect as updated when you check the repo on the gitlab website. Tutors and Markers can now also see the pushed code and we won't assume you haven't submitted anything. Yay!\n",
