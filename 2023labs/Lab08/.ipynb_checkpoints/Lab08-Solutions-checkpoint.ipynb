Each branch is given a branch number, which is unique throughout the company. Each branch is allocated staff, which includes a Manager. The Manager is responsible for the day-to-day running of a given branch. The data held on a member of staff is their name, position, and salary. Each member of staff is given a staff number, which is unique throughout the company. Each branch has a stock of videos. The data held on a video is the catalog number, video number, title, category, daily rental, cost, status, and the names of the main actors, and the director. The catalog number uniquely identifies each video. However, in most cases, there are several copies of each video at a branch, and the individual copies are identified using the video number. A video is given a category such as Action, Adult, Children, Drama, Horror, or Sci-Fi. The status indicates whether a specific copy of a video is available for rent."
