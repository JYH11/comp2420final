    ">In a recent study ([Gichoya et al, 2022](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00063-2/fulltext)), researchers found that standard Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning models can be trained to predict patients' racial identity from medical images and show high performance.  This high performance was obtained across multiple image modalities (i.e. different types of medical images like x-rays (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) range 0·91–0·99), CT  chest imaging (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) range 0·87-0.96) and mammography (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) 0.81)).  \n",
    "\n",
    ">The performance of the prediction model does not seem to rely on obvious confounders.  I.e., other factors that could have an association to race/racial identity, such as body-mass index, disease distribution and breast density, did not help explain the results obtained.  The research also showed that the deep learning models used performed well over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrums of the images, leading the authors to suggest that \"the efforts to control this behaviour when it is undesirable will be challenging and demand further study.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    ">At this stage, the researchers cannot explain how the AI models can predict racial identity from medical images.  The authors cautioned that the results from their study \"emphasise that the ability of AI deep learning models to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, the finding that AI can accurately predict self-reported race, even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images, often when clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging.\"  \n",

He would like to get either an SUV or a full-size sedan, and due to the current high petrol price, he wants to get the one with better fuel efficiency. To find out more, he has conducted some research online and found the following statement on a webpage: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Larger vehicles are notorious for guzzling gas. Since SUVs are heavier, even the most fuel-efficient vehicles in this category will get significantly fewer miles per gallon than sedans. On average, the most fuel-efficient SUVs average around 20-25 MPG, while sedans get anywhere from 30 to 40 MPG. The loss of fuel performance also comes with an increase in fuel cost, meaning more frequent stops at the gas station.\n",
