A one-time pad is uncrackable ([Terms and Conditions apply](https://medium.com/@canuteson/cracking-a-one-time-pad-a716a804d5bd)<sup>*</sup>). In the one-time pad encryption method , we need a key that is as long as the original message and each character in the original message is encrypted according to the character at the same position of the key. For example, for the same message 'attackatdawn' and given key 'sdifbsnoqwef', the first letter 'a' becomes 's' ('a' + 's' -> 's'), the second letter 't' becomes 'w' ('t' + 'd' -> 'w'), and so on.

    "In this question, you will be implementing a simplified RSA algorithm. RSA has been available for over 25 years, to varying key lengths. The algorithm is designed such that varying keys can be used, and larger keys generally mean larger security (as the factorisation becomes more computationally intensive). For many years, RSA Laboratories ran a competition to determine whether people can factorise (read: break) the RSA algorithm at varying key lengths. Although the competition is now withdrawn, many loyal researchers still continue to determine new and faster ways to break the algorithm. Most recently, [RSA-240 (a 795-bit key) was broken](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/12/03/new-rsa-factoring/). At this stage, while RSA-1024 is currently considered the most popular, RSA-2048 or RSA-4096 are considered safe (for now). \n",

    "To finish off, we will be looking at the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange as an example of Key Exchange algorithms. Recall a key exchange algorithm is required to securely communicate a secret key between two parties. This is used in Symmetric Key Cryptography, as the same key is required to encrypt and decrypt data. With Asymmetric Key Cryptography now so popular, key exchanges are now less common due to smaller uses of symmetric keys, although they are still used in some cases. \n",
